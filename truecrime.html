                    This book chronicles the history of the self-named "Zodiac" killer who was active in the 1960s and 70s in California from first hand details covered by Robert Graysmith's investigative efforts to unmask the "Zodiac" killer. The book describes the investigations of the many law enforcement branches such as the LAPD, the FBI, the CIA , etc., that worked on the case and other murders that the "Zodiac" had proclaimed he committed, including the 1966 Cheri Jo Bates stabbing.
