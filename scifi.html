                    Foundation is set in the future, when the world is barely remembered, and humans have colonized the galaxy. It is a captivating story with many themes; the most fascinating of these is the interplay of technology, religion, and government. While reading this novel, the cyclical view of history presented was a reminder that the Galactic Empire is not a completely far-fetched, fictional society.
