                    Originated from the Netflix Series "Our Beloved Summer", a coming-of-age romantic comedy that revolves around Choi Ung and Kook Yeon-soo, ex-lovers who broke up with a promise to never meet again. As luck would have it, the documentary they filmed ten years ago in high school went viral and they are forced to face the cameras together again by their producer friend. The series depicts their complicated feelings and growth.
